## Blockchain Governance

Blockchains implement through technology game theoretical principles of reward/punishment to induce or discourage certain behaviours as well as to create/share new digital assets in decentralised platforms. Further, blockchains enable novel autonomous systems governed by code-based rules, which are automatically enforced by the network. However, the “rule of code”, which is not controlled by anyone, may or may not be under the “rule of law”. Societal governance, imposed by centralised institutions, law and hierarchies or by social and familiar values, may clash with the new rule of code. What are the challenges, the opportunities and risks ahead? What is the role of lawyers in this transition? The ultimate question regarding on chain governance is: what is the role of code and law in society? Are they complementary, supplementary?
