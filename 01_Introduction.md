### What is Blockchain Law?

Introduction to Blockchain Law and Purpose of the course

 ### Historical Context
 
 Why?
 
In this first lesson we are going to analyse the invention of blockchain technologies in a historical context. We will review some of the ideological foundations that inspired and preceded its invention, which include the Austrian Economic School of Thought, Libertarianism and Cypherpunk movement of the 1980s. Understanding the ideological component will help us analyze better its economic, business and legal dimensions. We consider blockchain is a technological representation of different ideologies which we are going to identify and discuss.




#### Ideology
   ##### Austrian School and Libertarianism
   ##### Cypherpunk movement
   ##### Open Source movement
 
#### Technology
 ##### Commercial Internet
 ##### Cryptography
 ##### P2P networks
##### Digital currencies
##### Bitcoin, Ethereum & 3d generation blockchains


### Definitions 

What?

In this lesson we will describe what are blockchain networks from a technical, economical and legal perspective. Additionally we will study the architectural layers upon which they are built.

#### Technical layer
Distributed p2p database that maintains integrity / non-destructive way to track data changes /  “append - only database”
#### Business layer
„Trust“ machine (data integrity)  / Value transfer network  (dynamic)/ programmable business logic / self executable smart contracts / 
#### Legal layer
Transaction validation mechanism (use case transactional) / asset register (static) (use case record keeping) / self -executable smart contracts / documentation & transmission of ownership rights on digital assets
#### Political / Social layer
Protocols for reaching consensus / Creation and allocation of scarce resources and public goods / coordination of agents for a common purpose / decentralized governance
#### Infrastructure layers
OSI / ISO model;
TCP / IP model



  
  
### 3 How blockchains work?

How?

In this lesson we will explain the basic functioning of blockchain networks as well as an introduction to the most important technical and (crypto) economical concepts. We will underline the legal relevance of these concepts.


#### Cryptographic Hashes
Digital fingerprint. Unique identifier
#### Blocks
Data Sets with an order of transactions
#### Mining
#### Blockchains
#### Distributed Ledgers
#### Tokens
#### Transactions
Transmitting ownership rights of virtual assets
#### Asymmetric Cryptography
Public / Private Keys
Wallets
#### Digital Signatures
Proving authorship of a transaction
#### Nodes
#### Consensus
#### Cryptoeconomic concepts and incentives


### Architecture


#### Blockchains in the context of decentralization
#### Types of Blockchains
  Public / Consortium / Private
  Permissiones / Permissionless
#### Blockchain characteristics
 Public blockchains: Des intermediation / transnational / resilient / tamper resistant / transparent / pseudonimity / incentivation / consensus / autonomy / alegality
 Private blockchains:
 
 
### Introduction to Blockchain Governance
#### Principles of Blockchain Governance
#### Mechanisms of Blockchain Governance
#### Process vs. Design
#### On chain / off chain gov.
#### Layers of Blockchain Governance (permisionless/ permissioned)
##### Network Layer
##### Application Layer
#### Governance Processes
##### Poliycentricity
##### Stakeholders: 
Core DEvs / Nodes / Miners / Token Holders / Users
###### Forks
##### Governance Use cases


### Smart Contracts

#### Introduction to Smart Contracts
#### Smart Contract Design


### dApps & DAOs
#### Decentralized Applications (dApps)
#### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
#### The history and the future of Organizations


### Digital Ownership Rights and Smart Property
#### The nature of digital ownership rights
#### Documenting and transfering property right on digital assets (under which fundamental economic freedon they fall under EU law?)
#### Cryptoassets and the tokenization of the economy
#### Smart Property Types

### Use Cases and Legal Issues

#### Legal & Governance use cases
Smart Property / Trusts / Identity / Signature / Trust Accounting / Contract Drafting[3] / Escrow services / Contract Management & Procurement / Dispute resolution / Evidence (audit trails) & Proof services / Records / Notarization / Legal Services / Business of Law / Access to Justice / Legal Agreement Platforms / Securitization & Tokenization / IP & royalty payments / Corporate Governance / Public Registries
#### Legal issues and risks surrounding blockchain technologies and smart contracts

Private Law: Liability issues when code malfunctions or is hacked (allocation and distribution of risks in a malfunctioning blockchain network) / service levels and performance / expression of intent: Ricardian contracts / jurisdictional issues (contract law)/ enforceability and validity questions of smart contracts (identity, offer & acceptance, etc.) / dispute resolution / legal ownership of digital assets / insurance issues / Cryptoasset Taxonomy / IP ownership , OSS licenses / data a s property / Due Diligence (buy / sell) for investment sin blockchain startups / insurance

Public Law: Regulatory Law / competition law / legal evidence in court / tax law / criminal law / jurisdictional issues 

#### Regulatory issues and risks surrounding blockchain technologies and smart contracts
Data privacy: GDPR / consumer protection / securities regulations / money transmission / KYC & AML / environmental regulations


### Impact of blockchain technologies in the legal industry
New legal paradigms: The emergence of Crypto legal primitives
Evolution of core legal concepts: legal personalty / jurisdiction ...
Value generated by blockchain technologies
Des – Intermediation: Elimination Agency Risk /   disruption of rent seeking industries / algorithmic trust - problem of cooperation (tragedy of commons) - Game theory: solves problem of cooperation (prisoner's’ dilemma), permits cooperation in no trust environments
Self execution of smart contracts: reduction of counterparty risk (systemic risk?). Traditional intermediaries that validate and verify transactions (human based institutions) turn obsolete
 (but: new intermediaries: exchanges, wallets, oracles, miners, etc) 
Value generated by descentralization: independence from a centraliced third party / no single point of failure /  less risk of denial of service attack
Public infrastructure
Staking economy “Skin in the game”: Solving information and risk distribution asymmetries
Automation: efficiency gains
Reduction of verification costs (verificación of transaction attributes) and networking cost (ability to Bootstrap and operate a marketplace without an intermediary )   
Lowers transaction costs (gap between firm and the market)
