Digital Ownership Rights

Blockchain technologies provide us with whole new ways of describing, documenting, proving and transmitting digital ownership rights. 
Property rights are crucial for the wealth and economic development of nations, and arguably the most prominent blockchain use case 
for the legal profession.

This module will explain how property rights are enforced by blockchain networks and compare it to current legacy systems. 
Important concepts will be introduced: the first one are cryptographically secured assets (aka Cryptoassets), a new, emerging asset class, 
which fundamentally differs from other established asset classes such as shares and bonds. An overview on different taxonomy models as well
as its regulatory status will be provided. We will elaborate on the idea of tokenization (digital representation of assets on the 
blockchain) and its parallels to securitization. We will explore what type of real world assets, rights or interests can be digitally 
represented on the blockchain. One prominent example of this is the concept of smart property, which refers to ownership which is 
controlled by a blockchain network, which permits to “unbundle” property rights and generate liquidity for trillions of dollars currently 
locked in current illiquid assets.
