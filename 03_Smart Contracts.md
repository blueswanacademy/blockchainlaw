A Smart Contract is decentralised code that can move money or any type of digital good based on a condition. 
Smart contracts have particular characteristics as they execute autonomously, without human intervention. 
They are ideal for automatising the execution of obligations, such as payment, escrow, etc. and they can even 
replace certain legal agreements. Moreover, enforcement of contractual obligations turns obsolete, 
as all smart contracts are guaranteed to execute; the agreement contains its own execution. 
This poses many interesting questions for legal practitioners, as technology replaces partially the role of 
lawmakers, lawyers and judges. Will smart contracts become a new form of law? What is the role of law and lawyers 
in smart contract based transactions?
