Blockchain Law Course

Welcome to the world's first open Blockchain Law Course. The purpose of this course is to bridge the technical knowledge gap of legal practitioners and simultaneously bridge the legal knowledge gap of blockchain developers. Furthermore, this course aims to develop specific technical skills required by tomorrow's lawyers, including the design and implementation of code based regulatory frameworks, desentraliced governance systems, and self-executing, autonomus smart contracts. 
Blue Swan believes in the potential of blockchain technologies enabling digital commons.
For this reason the course will be fully open to the collaboration of the community and will have an open source license. We aim to contribute to the collective wisdom and incentivice the generation of knowledge in the gobal blockchain legal community. The course will be structured in a modular approach to facilitate participation and full flexibility at the development and consumption of content. 
Enjoy!
