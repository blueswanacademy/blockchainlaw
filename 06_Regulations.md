## Regulations

The regulatory framework for blockchain-based projects is complex. Our current legal systems are not prepared for decentralisation and there is a tension between decentralised code running in thousand of nodes worldwide and our centralised, national legal systems. Open, collaborative projects may take advantage of competing legal jurisdiction and switch to more favourable countries (jurisdictional arbitrage). In this module we will study blockchain as an object of regulation and the modes and layers that governments have to exert influence on its development. These include regulations on end users, transportation layers, information intermediaries, blockchain specific intermediaries, miners and transaction processors, hardware manufactures and social norms. Additionally, we will study the emergence of new legal fields.
