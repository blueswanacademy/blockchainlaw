Smart Contracts are computer programs that live on the blockchain and execute automatically. These computer program can be used to produce legal effects, move value and automate processes. The automatic execution of smart contracts inject digital trust in transactions and thus have the potential to replace human based institution such as lawyers. Therefore it is crucial for future blockchain lawyers to understand their potential and limitations, as well as the basics on smart contracts design. Interactions  of smart contracts enable the creation of DAOs, new types of decentralised organisations governed and controlled by blockchain networks, which will arguably coexist and even replace the current legal entities.
