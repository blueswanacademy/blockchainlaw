## Crypto Legal Primitives

In this module we will study the emergence of legal crypto primitives. 
Primitives are self-sustaining building blocks that will serve as the foundation for enabling and enforcing digital rights. 
Some of these primitives may include:

### 1. Management of ownership rights on digital assets
### 2. Delegation of trust
### 3. Blockchain Proof services
### 4. Cryptoassets (taxonomy)
### 5. Crypto collectives (NFT / RFT)
### 6. Smart Property, fractional ownership
### 7. Self-sovereign identity
### 8. Decentralised dispute resolution
### 9. Decentralised registers
### 10.Oracles
