## Crypto Legal Primitives

In this module we will study the emergence of legal crypto primitives. 

Primitives are self-sustaining building blocks, which are designed to do one specific task, and can be used in different contexts.  Cryptographic primitives, such as hashing functions and digital signatures, are the technological building blocks of blockchains, which have been complemented in blockchain networks by cryptoeconomic and financial primitives. Legal crypto primitives refer to performance obligations and risk management in blockchain based transactions, which can be expressed in deterministic code. Crypto Legal primitives will serve as the foundation for enabling and enforcing digital rights. 

Some of these primitives may include:

#### Management of ownership rights of digital assets (Owner ID / Property ID / Authentication / Authorization)
#### Parties of a transaction (Self-sovereign identity)
#### Payment terms
#### Title (Smart Property, fractional ownership, bundle of rights). Embodied in a NFT with subtokens that represent auxiliary rights
#### Termination primitives (change of state)
#### Dispute resolution
#### Limitation of Liability (cap payments in case of termination or dispute resolution procedure)
#### Vesting / option based primitives (condition activated by an oracle)
#### Escrow primitives (managed by multisig smart contracts)
#### Cryptoassets (taxonomy)
