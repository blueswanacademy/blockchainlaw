# Blockchain Law Course

Welcome to the world's first open Blockchain Law Course. Blockchain is the most exciting and disruptive technology of this generation and will permanently change the concept of law and the role of legal practitioners in our society. The development and implementation of the technology requires a whole new set of theoretical foundations and mental paradigms, which we have to develop together as a global community. Specific multidisciplinary skills will be required to draft self-executing, autonomous smart contracts, to design code - based regulatory frameworks, to implement governance and incentive systems for decentralised communites. New legal fields and disciplines will emerge in the following years.

Although the development of the technology is in its infancy, it already has an impact in the practice and business of law. We want to help identify and develop new use cases for the legal profession. Blockchains can add substantial efficiencies in legal interactions by des-intermediating transactions and automatizing processes. The value that is unlocked for the society is a huge opportunity for legal practitioners, but simultaneously a challenge. Our mission is to help implement this transition.

This repository should be seen as a tool for open collaboration that will help bridg the current knowledge and skill gap around blockchain technologies and their legal and regulatory dimensions. The project will be open for collaboration and the content will be integrated into the digital commons with a permissive, open source license. A modular approach will facilitate participation, development and consumption of content. 

We envision an open platform of producers, consumers and curators of relevant material for blockchain lawyers and simultaneously legal information for projects in the blockchain space.
