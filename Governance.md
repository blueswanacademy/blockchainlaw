## Blockchain Governance

Blockchain technologies are enabling the arisal of new type of decentralised organisations. Simultaneously they provide us with a toolkit to design and automate collective decision and governance. The possibility to design and test new governance models is unprecedented in human history and lead to fascinating political, sociological and philosophical discussions. In this module we will study the origins of the governance discussions in the context of open source software projects and then study its application to decentralized organizations and DAOs. We will provide a differentiation of different governance models depending on the type of blockchain (private / public / permissioned / unpermissioned), purpose and ideology. Further, we will elaborate on the important distinction between off chain ad on chain governance.
