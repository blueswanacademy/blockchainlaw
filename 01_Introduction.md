# Introduction to Blockchain Law

## Table of Contents Introduction to Blockchain Law

 ### 1 Historical Context
 
 Why?
 
In this first lesson we are going to analyse the invention of blockchain technologies in a historical context. We will review some of the ideological foundations that inspired and preceded its invention, which include the Austrian Economic School of Thought, Libertarianism and Cypherpunk movement of the 1980s. Understanding the ideological component will help us analyze better its economic, business and legal dimensions. We consider blockchain is a technological representation of different ideologies which we are going to identify and discuss.




#### 1.1 Ideology
   ##### 1.1.1 Austrian School and Libertarianism
   ##### 1.1.2 Cypherpunk movement
   ##### 1.1.3 Open Source movement
 
#### 1.2 Technology
 ##### 1.2.1 Commercial Internet
 ##### 1.2.2 Cryptography
 ##### 1.2.3  P2P networks
##### 1.2.4 Digital currencies
##### 1.2.5  Bitcoin, Ethereum & 3d generation blockchains


### 2 Definitions 

What?

In this lesson we will describe what are blockchain networks from a technical, economical and legal perspective. Additionally we will study the architectural layers upon which they are built.

#### 2.1 Technical layer
Distributed p2p database that maintains integrity / non-destructive way to track data changes
#### 2.2 Business layer
„Trust“ machine (data integrity)  / Value transfer network  (dynamic)/ programmable business logic 
#### 2.3 Legal layer
Transaction validation mechanism / asset register (static) / self -executable smart contracts / documentation & transmission of ownership rights on digital assets
#### 2.4 Political / Social layer
Creation and allocation of scarce resources and public goods / coordination of agents for a common purpose / decentralized governance
#### 2.5 Infrastructure layers
OSI / ISO model;
TCP / IP model



  
  
### 3 How Blockchains work?

How?

In this lesson we will explain the basic functioning of blockchain networks as well as an introduction to the most important technical and (crypto) economical concepts. A link to legal concepts will be provided.

Data Sets with an order of transactions
#### 3.3 Mining
#### 3.4 Blockchains
#### 3.5 Distributed Ledgers
#### 3.6 Tokens
#### 3.7 Transactions
Transmitting ownership rights of virtual assets
#### 3.8 Asymmetric Cryptography
Public / Private Keys
Wallets
#### 3.9 Digital Signatures
Proving authorship of a transaction

#### 4.1 Blockchains in the context of decentralization
#### 4.2 Types of Blockchains
  Public / Consortium / Private
#### 4.3 Blockchain characteristics
 Public blockchains: Des intermediation / transnational / resilient / tamper resistant / transparent / pseudonimity / incentivation / consensus / autonomy / alegality
 Private blockchains:
#### 4.4 Governance
#### 4.5 Use cases


### 5.	Impact of blockchain technologies in the legal industry
